# Udacity Multi User Blog Project

This was the third project for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. It allows for the users to create blog posts, and create comments. The live link can be found at http://blog-146200.appspot.com/

### How to Run this Project Locally
This site was written in Python 2.7, created using Jinja and Bootstrap, and runs on Google App Engine.
  - Download the latest version of Python 2.7 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Download Bootstrap [here](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  - Download the SDK for Google App Engine [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#null)

With everything installed you can now setup a free account for Google App Engine by following the instruction [here](https://sites.google.com/site/gdevelopercodelabs/app-engine/creating-your-app-engine-account). Now you should have everything you need to get everything running! New features will be added in the future when I have more time.
